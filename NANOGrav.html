							<p> Pulsars are rapidly spinning neutron stars that emit regular radio pulses, like cosmic lighthouses. 
								Among their countless scientific applications, we can use them as clocks scattered throughout our galaxy 
								to detect very low-frequency gravitational waves - specifically waves that oscillate once every few years 
								(nanoHertz frequencies). The main target is a "background hum" of gravitational waves created by pairs of 
								supermassive black holes orbiting each other at the centers of distant galaxies. When these gravitational waves 
								pass through our galaxy, they cause the radio pulses to arrive at Earth slightly earlier or later than expected. 
								These timing changes follow a specific pattern across different pulsars in the sky, described by the "Hellings and Downs curve."
								By monitoring dozens of pulsars for over a decade, with the NANOGrav collaboration we have now observed this predicted pattern of correlated timing 
								changes - providing evidence of a gravitational-wave background in nanoHertz frequencies.</p>

							<p>Analyzing decade-long data sets from dozens of pulsars is time- and resource-consuming. Caltech graduate student Sophie Hourihane led a study that proposed a faster
								but still accurate alternative. Rather than analyzing the data with a computationally expensive model that explicitly includes 
								spatial correlations, we instead employ an approximate model and then reweight the
								posterior to the full, expensive model. Through extensive simulations, Hourihane validated the accuracy and computational gains of this approach.
								The plot exemplifies the method and its robustness, now routinely used on real data.

							<p>Unlike LIGO that detects individual gravitational wave "chirps" when two black holes or neutron stars merger,
								NANOGrav detects a background "hum" made up of thousands of these signals all mixed together.
								Currently we can only measure two basic properties of this background: how strong it is (amplitude), and
								how its strength changes with frequency (spectral slope). This makes it challenging to be exactly sure about what 
								its origin is. With former Caltech postdoctoral scholar Pat Meyers, we developed a method to check whether our theoretical 
								models are correct. Our approach uses current models to predict what the data should look like and then 
								compare these predictions to what we actually observe. This method is called "posterior predictive checks." 
							</p>

							<span class="image left"><img src="images/NANOGravPPCReal.png" alt="" height="250"/></span>
							<p> After successfully testing our method method on simulated, computer-generated data, we applied it to the 
								actual gravitational-wave signal that NANOGrav discovered in real pulsar observations.
								Using NANOGrav's most recent and comprehensive dataset, Meyers and the collaboration reached two key conclusions.
								First, the gravitational-wave background follows a simple "power-law" pattern - its strength decreases  
								with frequency to some power. Second, the presence of spatial correlations - the specific pattern of timing changes 
								across pulsars that proves this is actually gravitational waves, was confirmed. This validation gives us confidence 
								that we are correctly interpreting the first detection of the gravitational-wave background, rather than mistaking it for something else.
