							<p> Pulsar timing arrays use pulsars as galactic-scale detectors to observe nanoHertz gravitational waves.
								The primary source for pulsar timing arrays is a stochastic background emitted by an ensemble of supermassive black hole binaries 
								at the center of galaxies or early universe processes. Gravitational waves impart a spatially correlated offset on the arrival times of pulses,
								described by the Hellings and Downs curce. Using an array of dozens of pulsars and decade-long datasets,
								evidence for such correlations was recently obtained, left plot. Our team works within the NANOGrav collaboration to
								analyze and interpret data as well as construct new data analysis methods and algorithms. </p>

							<p>Analyzing long data sets of dozens of pulsars is time and resource consuming. Caltech graduate student Sophie Hourihane led a study that proposed a faster
								but still accurate alternative. Rather than directly analyzing the data with the computationally expensive model that includes 
								spatial correlations, our method instead analyzes the data with an approximate, but faster, model and then reweights the resulting
								posterior to the full, expensive model. The right plot exemplifies the method and its robustness, now routinely used on real data.

							<p>Unlike LIGO, NANOGrav does not observe invididual compact binary mergers, but the combined stochastic signal from numerous
								sources. Since the only source characterization we have so far is its spectral features, determining the source origin compared to
								alternatives such as early universe processes is challenging. Led by Caltech postdoc Pat Meyers, we proposed a method to 
								assess whether our models for the signal spectrum (and its other characteristics such as the spatial correlations) are robust.
								Based on posterior predictive checks, our method compares the observed data to predicted data and assesses the robustness
								of the models used throughout the analysis. The left plot compares the observed and predicted data from a simulated data set.
