							<h1 class="major">LIGO and ground-based detectors</h1>
								The twin LIGO detectors and its partners, Virgo and KAGRA, have made dozens of detections of merging neutron stars and/or 
								black holes in the stellar-mass range. As part of the LIGO Laboratory at Caltech and the LIGO Scientific Collaboration, we analyze data from the ground-based LIGO detectors to infer the properties of merging black holes and neutron stars
								and contribute to papers prepared by the LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA collaborations.</p>
							<h3 class="major">Instrumental Glitches and Astrophysical Inference</h3>

							<span class="image left"><img src="images/GW200129.png" alt="" width="500" height="350"/></span>
							<p>Besides genuine astrophysical signals, the LIGO data also contain instrumental excess power, known as glitches.
								With diverse morphology, glitches can masquerade as a real signal or overlap with one and bias 
								measurement of the source properties. The very first neutron star binary detection, GW170817, overlapped with 
								a glitch that was ~30 times louder than the signal. We develop methods to mitigate the impact of glitches on 
								astrophysical inference. Our approach simultaneously models all data components, including the compact binary signal, the
								detector noise, and the glitch with a combination of modeled and morphology-independent analyses. We apply our method on
								real data of signals that overlap with glitches to subtract the latter and ensure that astrophysical inference on the 
								former is robust. Caltech graduate students Ethan Payne, Jacob Golomb, and Sophie Hourihane led a detailed
								study of the impact of an overlapping glitch on GW200129, left plot, and specifically its measurement of spin-precession.</p>

							<h3 class="major">The spins of black holes and neutron stars</h3>

							<p>In General Relativity the spins of compact objects interact gravitationally and thus affect the signal emitted
								during a binary inspiral. 
							</p>
							
								<span class="image right"><img src="images/AlignedSpin.gif" alt="" height="200"/></span>

								<p>Spin angular momenta aligned with the orbital angular momentum affect the length of the signal. 
									When the spin is positive (pointing "up" in a right-handed sense), the binary has more energy and angular 
									momentum that needs to be emitted before merger. The coalescence therefore lasts longer. 
									When the spin is negative (pointing "down") the signal is shorter. 
								</p>

								<span class="image left"><img src="images/PrecessingSpin.gif" alt="" height="200"/></span>

								<p>Spin angular momenta in the orbinal plane (perpendicular to the orbital angular momentum) cause spin-precession: 
									the spins and the orbital angular momentum precession in space.
									Since gravitational wave emission is primarily directed along the orbital angular momentum direction, this 
									spin-precession causes ampitude and phase modulations on the signal as the orbital angular momentum points towads
									or away from an observer. 
									 
								</p>

								<span class="image right"><img src="images/PrecessingSpinBoth.gif" alt="" height="200"/></span>

								<p>Spin angular momenta with both aligned and in-plane components affect both the length and the shape of the signal.
									Measuring the length of the signal is easier than identifying subtle amplitude modulations, we have therefore more 
									stringent contraints on aligned than in-plane spins. However, there are still a few gravitational wave events for which
									we can constrain the in-plane spins, leading to insights about the astrophysical environments in which these
									signals are formed.

								</p>

								<span class="image left"><img src="images/GW190521.gif" alt="" height="250"/></span>
								<p>We are interested in understanding how effects such as in-plane spins and eccentricity whose effect on the 
									waveform is subtle can be measured from heavy black hole binaries. For such systems we only observe the
									merger phase, where no analytical solutions exist for the signal. Caltech graduate student Simona Miller 
									led a study that examined subsets of data in the time domain to understand the imprint
									of spins across the signal. The left plot shows our results for GW190521, the most
									massive event to date. We showed that inference of spin-precession is subtle as it originates
									from the final, weak pre-merger cycle.
								</p>

								<span class="image right"><img src="images/SpinandTilts.png" alt="" width="300"/></span>
								<p>
									We also analyze graviational wave data to infer the astrophysical population of black hole spins. Tom Callister and 
									Caltech graduate student Simona Miller led a study that answered two key astrophysical questions about black hole spins: 
									do most black holes have exactly zero spins and are there binaries with negative aligned spins?
									Our answers are no and yes respectively, right plot. The first question informs models about stellar evolution
									and how massive stars collapse to black holes and the second question relates to whether black 
									hole bianries form isolated in the field or in dense, dynamical environments. 
								</p>

								<h3 class="major">Future data analysis challenges</h3>

								<span class="image left"><img src="images/Confusion.png" alt="" width="500" height="300"/></span>
								<p>Next-generation detectors beyond LIGO are envisioned to be able to observe black hole and neutron star 
									binaries almost to the 
									edge of the Universe. In order to take advantage of these signal-rich data sets we are transfering 
									knowledge and expertise from LISA data analysis to address issues such as multiple overlapping sources
									and noise non-stationarity. The left plot shows a typical simulated data set from such detectors where 
									multiple neutron star binary signals coincide in time and overlap in time-frequency. 
									This study, led by Caltech postdoc Aaron Johnson, showed that even though there are dozens to hundreds
									of overlapping signals, their density is not high enough to lead to significant source confusion. Our
									results indicate that LISA data analysis methods, constructed to address much more severe source confusion,
									are also applicable for next-generation ground-based detectors.
