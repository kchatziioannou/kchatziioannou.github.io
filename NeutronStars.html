						<p>With densities exceeding the nuclear saturation density, neutron stars are the most extreme material objects we know of.
							The properties and composition of dense nuclear matter inside neutron stars remain elusive.
							The equation of state of neutron star matter is the subject of both microscopic (nuclear calculations and terrestrial nuclear experiments) 
						and macroscopic (astronomical measurements of neutron star masses, radii, and tidal properties) studies.
						Gravitational waves offer information about the neutron star internal composition during the late stages of
						a compact binary coalescence. Before the merger, tidal interactions speed up the inspiral
						as the binary accelerates toward the collision. After the merger of two neutron stars, the highly deformed merger remnant
						keeps emitting a strong (yet, still unobserved) signal.</p>

						<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/NeutronStardata.png" alt="" width="400" height="250"/></span></p>
						<p>We use gravitational wave data together with electromagnetic data and nuclear theory and experiments to
							study the properties of dense supranuclear matter and the equation of state of cold matter in beta equilibrium. In a study led by Caltech graduate student Isaac Legred,
							we used gravitational wave data from GW170817, radio data from J0740, and X-ray data from J0740 and J0030
							to place constraints on the neutron star equation of state. The plot shows our inference on the neutron star
							mass-radius relation. Gravitational wave data provide an upper
							limit on how big neutron star are and how strong the internal pressure is, while radio and X-ray data provide a lower limit. Our constraints are based
							on a flexible model for the neutron star equation of state constructed with Gaussian processes. A primary 
							focus of our work is the impact of such equation of state models and ensuring that constraints are guided
							by data rather than model assumptions.</p>
						
						<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/LowMassClassification.png" alt="" height="300"/></span></p>
						<p>We are further interested in the astrophysical properties of neutron stars such as their mass and spin distributions as well as
							their relation to the astrophysical properties of black holes.
							In a study led by Caltech graduate students Jacob Golomb and Isaac Legred, we considered a potential detection of a 
							subsolar-mass compact binary with LIGO. Low-mass neutron stars are less compact and thus very deformable, making them
							observationally distinct to black holes.
							We proposed that the expected large tidal deformation of such low-mass neutron stars will enable us to robustly identify 
							whether subsolar-mass compact binaries are comprised of neutron stars or black holes (of likely primordial origin).
							The plot compares the expected tidal deformability of neutron stars based on equation of state inference with the measurement
							obtained from a specific simulated compact binary.
