						<h1 class="major">Neutron stars and dense matter</h1>
						<span class="image right"><img src="images/BNSWaveform.png" alt="" height="200"/></span>

						<p> Neutron stars are the most extreme material objects we know of. With densities exceeding the nuclear saturation density,
							the properties and composition of dense nuclear matter inside neutron stars remain elusive.
							The study of the equation of state of neutron star matter combines microscopic (nuclear calculations and terrestrial nuclear experiments) 
						and macroscopic (astronomical measurements of neutron star masses, radii, and tidal properties) information.
						Gravitational waves offer insights on the equation of state during the late stages of
						a compact binary coalescence. Before the merger, tidal interactions speed up the inspiral
						as the binary accelerates toward the collision. After the merger of two neutron stars, the highly deformed merger remnant
						keeps emitting a strong (yet, still unobserved) signal.</p>

						<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/NeutronStardata.png" alt="" width="500" height="300"/></span></p>
						<p>We use gravitational wave data together with electromagnetic data and nuclear theory and experiments to
							study the equation of state of supranuclear matter in beta equilibrium. In a study led by Caltech graduate student Isaac Legred,
							we used gravitational wave data from GW170817 and GW190425, radio data from J0740, and X-ray data from J0740 and J0030
							to place constraints on the equation of state. The plot shows our inference on the neutron star
							mass-radius relation. Gravitational wave data provide an upper
							limit on the radius and the internal pressure, while radio and X-ray data provide a lower limit. Our constraints are based
							on a flexible model for the equation of state constructed with Gaussian processes. A primary 
							focus of our work is the impact of such equation of state models and ensuring that constraints are guided
							by data rather than model assumptions.</p>
						
						<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/LowMassClassification.png" alt="" height="300"/></span></p>
						<p>We are further interested in the astrophysical properties of neutron stars such as their mass and spin distributions as well as
							their relation to black holes.
							In a study led by Caltech graduate students Jacob Golomb and Isaac Legred, we considered a potential detection of a 
							subsolar-mass compact binary with LIGO. Low-mass neutron stars are less compact and thus very deformable; telling them
							apart from black holes is therefore easier with gravitational wave data.
							We proposed that the expected large tidal deformation of such low-mass neutron stars will enable us to robustly identify 
							whether subsolar-mass compact binaries are comprised of neutron stars or black holes (of likely primordial origin).
							The plot compares the expected tidal deformability of neutron stars based on equation of state inference with the measurement
							obtained from a simulated signal.

						<p>Nature or nurture? Are the properties of neutron stars that exist in the Universe determined the properties of the nuclear matter they 
							are made of or by the astrophysical processes they undergo after they are created? This is particularly relevant for the maximum mass 
							of neutron stars; nuclear physics imposes an absolute maximum, but the different astrophysical environments in which the neutron stars
							we observe exist might not allow for this absolute maximum to be realized in the Universe. To begin addressing this question, Caltech graduate students 
							Jacob Golomb and Isaac Legred led a study that constructed and validated a new framework for analyzing neutron star data.
							The novelty of the framework is that it separates the neutron star 
							equation of state from the neutron star mass distribution and measures both. 
							Using current data, we found no evidence that astrophysics restricts the masses of neutron 
							stars to lower values than those allowed by nuclear physics. So far, nurture wins.
