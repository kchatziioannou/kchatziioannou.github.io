							<h1 class="major">Testing General Relativity</h1>
							<p> Compact binary observations enable unique strong-field tests of General Relativity, the most successful framework
								for understanding gravity availble so far. Tests of General Relativity are complicated by the lack of complete alternative
								frameworks or theories that have been studied in similar detail as General Relativity. Our efforts
								instead focus on constructing tests for the fundamental properties of gravitational waves, such as their 
								polarization content.</p>

							<span class="image left"><img src="images/TGRGraviton.png" alt="" height="300"/></span>
							<p>We are also constructing a robust statistical framework for combining information on deviatons from General
								Relativity from the sozens of compact binary observations currently available. Our framework relaxes common assumptions about the kind of deviations 
								we expect and instead targets the population distribution of potential beyond-General Relativity effects. Caltech graduate
								student Ethan Payne led a study that further extended the framework to also include the population distribution of the black hole masses and spins, thus
								fortifying our tests of General Relativity against astrophysics assumptions and systematics. This work led to the tighest constraint for the mass
								of the graviton with gravitational waves to date, left plot.

							<p>In another extension to this population framework, Caltech staff scientist Ryan Magee led a study of the impact of selection effects
								on population constraints. Since searches for gravitational wave signals are based on waveforms predicted
								by General Relativity, it is possible that we are missing a large number of sources whose signals deviate strongly from the 
								theory. Our results, right plot, indicate that the impact of selection effects is in fact minimal for parametrized tests of the gravitational
								wave phase. Current constraints on
								General Relativity deviations are already so strong that selection effects are subdominant. </p>
