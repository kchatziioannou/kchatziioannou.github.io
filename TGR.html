							<h1 class="major">Testing General Relativity</h1>
							<p> Compact binary observations enable unique strong-field tests of General Relativity. 
								Such tests are complicated by the lack of complete alternative
								frameworks or theories that have been as extensively studied as General Relativity. One aspect of our efforts
								 focuses on constructing tests for the fundamental properties of gravitational waves, such as their 
								polarization content.</p>

							<span class="image left"><img src="images/TGRGraviton.png" alt="" height="300"/></span>
							<p>We are also constructing a robust statistical framework for combining information on deviations from General
								Relativity from the dozens of compact binary observations currently available. Our framework relaxes common assumptions about expected deviations 
								and instead targets the population distribution of potential beyond-General Relativity effects. A study led by Caltech graduate
								student Ethan Payne extended the framework to include the population distribution of the black hole masses and spins, thus
								fortifying our tests of General Relativity against astrophysics assumptions and systematics. This work led to the tightest constraint to date for the mass
								of the graviton with gravitational waves.

							<p>Caltech staff scientist Ryan Magee also led a study of the impact of selection effects
								on tests of General Relativity. Since searches for gravitational wave signals are based on waveforms predicted
								by General Relativity, it is possible that we are missing a large number of sources whose signals deviate strongly from 
								General Relativity. Our results indicate that the impact of selection effects is in fact minimal for parametrized tests of the gravitational
								wave phase. Current constraints on deviations from
								General Relativity are already strong enough to make selection effects subdominant. </p>
