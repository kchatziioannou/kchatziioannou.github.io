							<p>The LISA space-based gravitational-wave detector will face a unique challenge. The large number of signals 
								overlapping in the LISA dataset requires a "global fit" in which an unknown number of sources are modeled 
								simultaneously. This includes dozens to hundreds of massive black hole binaries, hundreds of extreme mass 
								ratio inspirals, millions of galactic white-dwarf binaries, and many more.
								This introduces a "label-switching ambiguity" for sources in the same class that overlap, making it challenging 
								to distill a traditional astronomical catalog. Unlike current ground-based detectors that typically see 
								individual events, LISA will be extremely signal-dense, with millions 
								of binary systems in our own galaxy, thousands of which will be resolvable, overlapping in frequency and time. 
								The label-switching problem means that even though we can detect these thousands of resolvable binaries, it will be
								hard to tell which is which. This means that trying to catalog individual sources in order to study them further, 
								is not straightforward.

							<p>Caltech postdoctoral scholar Aaron Johnson led a study that proposed a solution to the label-switching problem.
							   The PETRA algorithm (it stands for something, but in reality it is named after a cat!) solves the label-switching 
							   problem by using an iterative strategy to sort out which detected signals correspond to which actual 
							   gravitational-wave sources. The algorithm first fits all the (at this point mixed up) sources with a simple model. It 
							   then systematically reassigns or "shuffles" the source labels - essentially trying different ways of matching the 
							   measured parameters to individual sources - and picks the arrangement that makes the most sense from an 
							   astronomical perspective. The final result is a clean catalog where each detected binary system has well-defined 
							   properties and a probability of being a real astrophysical source, transforming what was initially a confusing 
							   jumble of overlapping signals into an organized list that astronomers can use to study individual 
							   gravitational-wave sources throughout the galaxy.							</p>
